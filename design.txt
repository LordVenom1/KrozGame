Made from scratch engine and code design.  Written from scratch in 1 day.
Borrowed free art assets
Unlicensed game design and levels from Kroz, an old shareware game from the late 80s/early 90s
	Games are open-source PASCAL but not a free license

Written in Ruby
Use high-level graphics library Gosu (which uses OpenGL)

* input system
* rudimentary component system
* simple inheritance 1-2 levels
* save and load
* floor tiles are stored in a simple 2d array
* sprite caching
* level loader
	* some layers of organization around mapping maps in original kroz format to tiles/components/sprites - yaml
* game runs real-time from Gosu loops (update, draw)
* drawing is done immediate
* some reading of original source to make systems work per the original

Goals:
* make a complete game that's playable
* make a game with decent graphics by dropping in free assets
* demonstrate basic ability to structure a non-trivial program, complete
* publish on itch.io

Todo:
	switch actions to command paradigm
DONE	simplify component_at... should be a single slot
	compare enemy behavior to original
	build up level designer
	components are a mess? event system?
	
	clean up player action.  needing to recheck right before acting sucks	

    "gems give you points and health"
    "press any key to begin the level"
	"stairs take you to the next lower level"
	
	more cool animations, weak walls crumbling, torches, etc
	avoid holding a button?  'w' can use multiple whips...
	
move level load/generator to separate file
flesh out render state more?
can monsters hit invis weak walls?  lv 4
static animation of monsters
invis things,  hidden things..  
all the tiles


level 6 hide weak walls
level 8 sideways -   Fast:=#234;{or #1}
  Convert_Format;
  LavaFlow:=true; LavaRate:=75;
  GravOn:=true;GravRate:=0;Sideways:=true;
 end; { Level8 }
level 10 hide gems
level 12 lava flow   Fast:=#234;{or #1}
  Convert_Format;
  LavaFlow:=true; LavaRate:=30;
 end; { Level12 }
 
mvoe player tick logic to player component?
  
DONE yikes do we create a new player or just set our player's location to the new place?
 
DONE can an exit tunnel have 0 valid positions?  just check all 8 then abort?
how to do random generation
how to do sideways levels?

foundset - hints  (each level: FoundSet:=FoundSet-[0,8,15,17,19..21,22,26,28,36,66];)
what else can bombs destroy?
	def on_bomb
		inactivate
	end
