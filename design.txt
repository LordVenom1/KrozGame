Made from scratch engine and code design.  Written from scratch in 1 day.
Borrowed free art assets
Unlicensed game design and levels from Kroz, an old shareware game from the late 80s/early 90s
	Games are open-source PASCAL but not a free license

Written in Ruby
Use high-level graphics library Gosu (which uses OpenGL)

* input system
* rudimentary component system
* simple inheritance 1-2 levels
* save and load
* floor tiles are stored in a simple 2d array
* sprite caching
* level loader
	* some layers of organization around mapping maps in original kroz format to tiles/components/sprites - yaml
* game runs real-time from Gosu loops (update, draw)
* drawing is done immediate
* some reading of original source to make systems work per the original

Goals:
* make a complete game that's playable
* make a game with decent graphics by dropping in free assets
* demonstrate basic ability to structure a non-trivial program, complete
* publish on itch.io

Todo:
	fix lava
	switch actions to command paradigm
	compare enemy behavior to original
	build up level designer
	component cleanup.  more sensible defaults?  modules?
	event system??	
	populate remaining first-time hints system
	more cool animations, weak walls crumbling, torches, etc
	flesh out render state more?
	events
	move level load/generator to separate file
	can monsters hit invis weak walls?  lv 4
	static animation of monsters

difficulties
	ran into minor issues with character encodings but notepad++ 'just worked'.  had to change
	approaches when automatically writing out the random levels


lessons learned
  longer than expected, more features.
  look more at original source.  started reimplementing things then ended up adjusting to be closer to real rules.
  may try more of a port approach
  try a more systems approach?  raise events and let the 'scorer' watch for them so that all score stuff is in one place etc.
  overall things went smoothly, adding a new feature was never too jarring/overwhelming.
  being strict about things on the board seemed to help, but an extra status to be off the board might simplify code in a few places

ideas:
	add high score
	add the other 6 episodes.  how different are features?
	custom map editor, sharing maps
	

level 6 hide weak walls
level 8 sideways -   Fast:=#234;{or #1}
  Convert_Format;
  LavaFlow:=true; LavaRate:=75;
  GravOn:=true;GravRate:=0;Sideways:=true;
 end; { Level8 }
level 10 hide gems
level 12 lava flow   Fast:=#234;{or #1}
  Convert_Format;
  LavaFlow:=true; LavaRate:=30;
 end; { Level12 }
 
mvoe player tick logic to player component?
  
DONE yikes do we create a new player or just set our player's location to the new place?
 
DONE can an exit tunnel have 0 valid positions?  just check all 8 then abort?
how to do random generation
how to do sideways levels?

foundset - hints  (each level: FoundSet:=FoundSet-[0,8,15,17,19..21,22,26,28,36,66];)
what else can bombs destroy?
	def on_bomb
		inactivate
	end

DONE random color of borders,gems
DONE review score
DONE review whipping things
review flashes
review thigns affected by difficulty...

play through...

DONE on level 6 can whip the things at hte bottom to reveal them as a altar thing
can whip away krozes - review what can be destroyed by whips?
on lv 8, when stepping on drop rope, it disappears under you and you fall.
monster generator puts them anywhere?  white then red?
DONE you can't teleport onto stops
monster animations - bobbing

pit falling animation...
make droprop a blocking anim?
adjust lava gen
do tree gen
spell bars

which wall trigger traps can be whipped?

main menu
check death state
high score

rocks should be able to smush enemies
cleanup saves.  make a true save/load system might be best?  get rid of restarting?  or autosave?
